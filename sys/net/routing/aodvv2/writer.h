/**
 * @brief   Wrapper for the rfc5444_writer_target that the _write_packet() callback receives.
 *          _write_packet() needs to know the type, payload and target address
 *          of the RFC5444 message to be sent as well, but the oonf api does not
 *          offer this feature. Having this wrapper enables the use of the
 *          container_of macro to fetch this information. It is hacky, but it does the trick.
